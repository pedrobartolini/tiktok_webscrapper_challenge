### Tiktok Webscrapper Challenge

This project relates to a 1x1 challenge (time attack) that I participated and won. The goal was to get the number of followers, following and likes of an tiktok user reliably enough and as fast as possible.

This took 10 minutes to complete and I was the first to finish it even tho it was my first time writing a webscrapper.
